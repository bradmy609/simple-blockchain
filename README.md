*Block.py* is the foundational module, and *Blockchain.py* builds a list of the data structure defined in *Block.py*, with a block at each index of the list. From there, *Script.py* implements the blockchain described in the Blockchain class, showing a few of the calculations that can be performed, and how the data can be maintained. It also demonstrates the proof of work method, and shows how challenging it is to compromise the blockchain's ledger.
